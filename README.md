QUANTITATIVE   METHODS   2A
1.    Suppose that one student wanted to study the following research question: whether investing   abroad can   help   improve   a firm’s   productivity?   He   randomly selected   12 firms,   and   recorded   their   productivities    before   and   after   they   started    investing   abroad    in   the   following   table   (assume that firm productivity follows normal distribution)   :

2.6(a)             At α    =   0.05, test whether productivities after firms invest abroad are higher than before.   (7 Marks)
(b)             Does the approach adopted by this student perfectly answer his research question   : does   investing abroad help improve a firm’s productivity?    Provide some arguments that may   challenge his approach   and   result.       (4 Marks)
2.   A    researcher    obtains    a      sample    with      number    of      observations   n   =    100   ,    and      population   standard   deviation σ    =   1   .   He   uses   this   sample   to   formulate   the   following   hypothesis   test:   H0: μ   ≤   1, and Ha : μ    >   1   .   He chooses the significance   level   α    =   0.05.
(a)             What   is the   probability of   making   a   type   I   error?       (2 Marks)
(b)             What   is the   power of the test   if the   true   population   mean μT       =    1.   1?       (5 Marks)
(c)             How large   a sample   size   n    would   be   required   in   (b) so   as to   obtain   a   power   of the test   equal to   90%?       (4 Marks)
3.    Suppose   that you want to   investigate   whether   movie   preference   is   associated   with   age. You   randomly surveyed   1000 people and obtained the following contingency table.

At the   1% significance level, test whether movie preference   is   independent   of age.       (10 Marks)
4.    Suppose that you want to   compare   innovation   behaviour   of   firms   across   different   ownership   in   a   given   industry.   You   randomly   selected   代 写BUSI2105 QUANTITATIVE METHODS 2A AUTUMN SEMESTER 2022-2023Python

(a)             At the   5% significance   level, test whether the   number   of   patents   is   the   same   between   Private-owned firms and State-owned firms.        (8 Marks)
(b)             At the 5% significance level, test   whether   the   number   of   patents   is   the   same   across   all   types of firms.        (9 Marks)
5.    (a)    Does   the   matrix      have   an    inverse?   If   your   answer   is   yes,   use   Gaussian
elimination to find the inverse of this matrix. If your answer   is   no, explain   why.        (7 Marks)(b)   Suppose f(x,   y,   z)   =   x   2    + y   2    + z   2    + xy   + yz   + x   + z.    Find   the   first   order   conditions   and   use   Cramer’s   rule   to   solve   the   stationary   point(s).   Determine   whether   each   stationary   point   is   a   local minimum or   maximum, or   saddle.        (9 Marks)
6.    Bob’s utility function is given by   ln   x   + lny   − k   2   , where x    and y    are consumptions of   two goods,   and k    is the number of   hours   spent   working.
(a)             Optimize   this   utility   function   subject   to   budget   constraint px   +   qy   =   wk,   where p    and q   are   prices   of x    and y    respectively   and w    is   the   hourly   wage   rate.   Use   the   Lagrangian   approach to find the stationary point(s) of this optimization problem.       (4 Marks)
(b)             Verify whether these stationary point(s) are   indeed   local   maximum.        (9 Marks)


7.    Integration
(a)             Compute the   indefinite   integration(5 Marks)
(b)             Determine the area to the left   of g(y)   =   3–   y2       and to the right   of x    =   −1   .   (6 Marks)
8.    Difference   Equations.
(a)               Solve 2xt    + xt−1      =   6    for x0      =   1.       (4 Marks)
(b)             Solve 6xt      −   5xt−1      + xt−2      =   2    for x0       =   1   and x1    =   2   .           (7 Marks)
