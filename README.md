1.   To   stimulate   the   economy   after   COVID-19   pandemic,   many   cities   in   China   introduced   the   consumer coupon.   A researcher wants to study whether such consumer coupon has effectively   increased the number of households’ transactions within a given period of time, so   he collects   a sample of cities that have introduced the consumer coupon and a sample   of cities that   have   not. The   summary   statistics   are   listed   below   (assume   that the two   populations   are   normally   distributed)   :

(a)             At α    =   0.01, test whether the consumer coupon   has effectively   increased the   number of   transactions (assume equal population variance). (10 Marks) 
(b)             In   your opinion, what are the potential problems of   the above test of   difference in means 
using   independent samples?   Explain why   it could   be   better to   use   matched samples   in   this case. (6 Marks) 
2.    Suppose that you want to study the performances in QM2A of students from different   majors.   You randomly select some students and record their marks of   final exam in the following table,   categorizing these students according to the majors they belong to.

(a)             If you want to   investigate   whether   the   mean   mark   of   students   is   the   same   across   the   above three majors, what test would you use? Explain the intuition of how such test can   achieve this research objective. (4 Marks)
(b)             Based   on   the   above   data,   test   whether   the   mean   mark   is   the   same   across   different   majors at the 5%   significance   level. (12 Marks) 
(c)             At the   10% significance   level, test whether the   variance   of   marks   is   the   same   between   FAM students and IBE   students. (8 Marks)
3.   Consider the following   linear simultaneous equation system   in x,   y,   z.
x − y + z = 1                                                                (1)
2x + y + z = 4                                                               (2)

(a)             Express this system in matrix form. AX    =   b, with vector X   =   [x          y           代 写BUSI2105 QUANTITATIVE METHODS 2A AUTUMN SEMESTER 2020-2021Processing
代做程序编程语言  z]T . Find the inverse   of the coefficient   matrix A    using   its determinant   and adjoint   matrix. (10 Marks) 
(b)             Solve the system   using   Cramer’s   Rule.        (6 Marks)
4.   A   household   has   the   utility   function U    =   ln(q1)   + ln(q2),   where q1       and q2       are   the   quantities   of   consumption of two types of goods. The budget constraint is given by p1   q1    + p2   q2    =   200, where   p1      and p2      are prices of q1       and q2       respectively. The household is a   price taker.
(a)             Using the Lagrange function approach, determine the optimal quantities of   consumption   q1      and q2      that maximize the household’s utility   (taking the   prices   as given).       (6 Marks)
(b)             Based    on    the      Bordered      Hessian    verify      that      your      solution      indeed      constitutes      a   maximum of   utility. (6 Marks) 
(c)             If the   price   for   goods   1   increases   from p1       =   5    to p1(′)   =    10, other things   equal,   how   large is the loss of the household’s   consumer   surplus? (6 Marks) 
5.   The inventory of a firm Qt       adjusts as   follows:
Qt+1      =   PQ   t    +   τItwhere It       is the   investment that adds   new   inventory. P    captures the depreciation   of   inventory   such   that   each   period,   1   − P    share   of   the    inventory   is    lost,   and   0   < P < 1 . τ measures the efficiency of transforming investment into inventory, and 0 < τ < 1 .(a)             If investment    It       is a constant It      =   I(̅), express Qt      as a function of t    (assume that   the initial inventory   is Q0   ) (3 Marks)(b)             If It       =   I(̅)   + βQt ,   where β    captures   the    reaction   of   investment   to   the   current   inventory level, express Qt       as a function of t    (assume that Q0       is   known). (5 Marks) 
(c)             Discuss the   dynamic trajectories   of Qt       that you   obtained   in   (a)   and   (b)   respectively. (6 Marks)
6.   A    researcher    wants   to    investigate    whether   the    investment    preference    is    independent    of   gender. He randomly selects   1000 people and   makes   the   following   contingency table:

Most Favorite Investment 
Gender 
Stock 
Time Deposit 
P2P 
Trust Fund 
Real Estate 
Male 
90 
36 
50 
120 
310 
Female 
50 
63 
30 
80 
171 
At α   =   0.05, can the researcher conclude that the preference   is   associated with   gender        (12   Marks)
